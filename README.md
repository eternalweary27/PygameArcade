# PygameArcade
A variety of games implemented in the pygame framework. Game Menu implented using Python inbuilt GUI library tkinter while games are made using pygame. Project started off with 6 simple games - Pong, Shooter, Dino, Snake, Life and Typing - with additional plans to add more games in the future. Shooter game is heavily inspired by Chris Courses JavaScript & Canvas game on Youtube, while Typing game is heavily inspired by Bisqwit's version.
